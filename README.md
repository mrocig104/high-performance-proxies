## FAQ

**Which proxy type works best for web scraping without getting blocked?**

Residential proxies from providers like Bright Data, Oxylabs, or SOAX deliver highest success rates for sophisticated scraping because traffic originates from real residential IPs. For sites with moderate anti-bot systems, static residential (ISP) proxies from IPRoyal or Smartproxy provide datacenter speeds with residential legitimacy at lower costs. Budget-conscious projects can start with Webshare's datacenter proxies and upgrade if blocking becomes problematic.

**How do I choose between datacenter, residential, and mobile proxies?**

Datacenter proxies excel for speed-critical tasks where sites don't aggressively block non-residential IPs—competitive intelligence, SEO monitoring, or basic scraping. Residential proxies handle sophisticated anti-bot systems and account-based activities where authenticity matters. Mobile proxies prove essential for mobile-specific verification, social media automation, and scenarios where mobile traffic receives preferential treatment.

**What's the most cost-effective proxy solution for beginners?**

Webshare provides 10 completely free datacenter proxies indefinitely, perfect for learning and low-volume testing. When scaling beyond free limits, Smartproxy balances affordability with features starting at $1.5 per GB for residential proxies.
